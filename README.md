# Let's see wifi password using python
Normally, in order to access a network when connecting to WiFi, we have to provide a password. However, we are unable to view the password we have previously entered, which is the password of the network that has been kept. In this Repo, we will look at how to use Python's subprocess module to get all saved WiFi names and passwords.
Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that makes it possible for mobile devices, wearables, laptops, and desktop computers to connect to the Internet.
By creating new processes, the subprocess module in Python (both 2.x and 3.x) is used to run extra programmes or applications that use Python code. Getting the input, output, error, and exit codes for different commands is also helpful.
